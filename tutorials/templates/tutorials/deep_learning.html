    <h1 class="title">Intro to Deep Learning</h1>
    <p class="text">Many consider the field of deep learning to be the "next big thing". Let's see why.</p>
    <h3 class="subtitle">Deep Learning?</h3>
    <p class="text">This term comes a lot in modern day discussions regarding tech. Simply put, it is the subfield
        of machine learning that deals specifically with artificial neural networks. The "deep" part comes from
        the fact that the networks have multiple varied layers. This field has the potential to be very powerful,
        even though it practically is already. Its algorithmic structure allows it be very intelligent, meaning it has
        the ability to do more advanced tasks than other traditional algorithms.
    </p>
    <h3 class="subtitle">How Do Neural Networks Work?</h3>
    <p class="text">Now what I will say may in this section may sound superficial and unintuitive—and it is—so bare with me.
        Neural networks in the core are complex algorithms, which is why it can do advanced stuff. But we don't need
        to know how <em>exactly</em> it works, but rather how it works from the surface level and how we can use it. 
        Otherwise I would have to teach you guys linear algebra and third year college calculus.
    </p>
    <p class="text">I would describe neural networks as this: function approximators. The main goal of a neural network is
        like of a regression analysis, but now with multiple inputs and outputs. Neural networks usually are divided into
        3 layers: input, hidden, and output. We will use the diagram below as an example. The input layer takes in values, 
        perhaps each node or neuron taking in one pixel within an image, then transfers that input into the hidden layers.
        These "hidden" layers take in the values and apply some kind of mathematical operation (usually sum of all inputs then mx + b). 
        Honestly speaking, we do not care what goes within these hidden layers, because these computations are too complex to be 
        intuitive. These hidden layers then transfers the transformed data to the output layers, which might represent if that image 
        is a cat or a dog.

    <p class="text">So the neural network performs all these computations for each input (pixel in the example), for each layer, 
        but what's the point? How does it find if that image is of a dog or a cat? Well, the answer is that it doesn't, at first.
        It takes consecutive tries to "train" the algorithm to know if it a dog or a cat, it doesn't automatically get it. It
        "learns" how to distinguish between the two through the process of <em>gradient descent</em> and <em>backpropogation</em>. 
        The network takes each try and adjusts its mathematical operations in the layers to try to get less <em>error</em>. Ultimately,
        the network wants to limit how wrong it is by gauging the error through what we call <em>loss/cost functions.</em> Using that
        loss function, we compute what "step" we want to take to reduce the loss (error), through gradient descent. Don't worry about
        understanding what gradient descent is, its just a way to direct to the minimum of a graph. This minimum would be where the error
        would be minimal. Then we take that "step" or adjust our mathematical operations within the layers through backpropogation, which
        is where the meat of the math is concentrated, which we won't need to know how it works.

    <h3 class="subtitle">...What?</h3>
    <p class="text">Yeah, that's a lot to take in, innit? I wouldn't blame you if you weren't able to get it, after all,
        it took me a whole week to understand the whole concept. I highly recommend checking out 
        <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi">3Blue1Brown's videos</a>
        on this topic, he explains it a lot better. Don't worry if you still don't get it, I am gonna post an example, which should surely
        help, as it did for me. It will be on the MNIST dataset, the one used in the video. We will be making a neural network
        that can recognize handwritten digits out of that dataset.
